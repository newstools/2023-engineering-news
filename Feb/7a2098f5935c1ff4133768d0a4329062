Air India, the private-sector national flag carrier for the giant Asian country, on Tuesday announced the biggest ever single order for airliners. The order has been split between the world’s top two commercial airliner companies, Airbus and Boeing, although not on a 50:50 basis: the carrier has shown a preference for Airbus types. A consequence of Air India’s decision is that aeroengine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has received the biggest order so far for its Trent XWB-97 turbofan engines. From Airbus, Air India has ordered a total of 250 aircraft. This number is divided into 210 single-aisle airliners (further subdivided into 140 A320neo and 70 larger A321neo aircraft, the suffix -neo standing for new engine option) and 40 new-generation wide-body aircraft (also subdivided, into 34 A350-1000s and six A350-900s). “Airbus has been a longstanding partner of Air India, and these new aircraft will play an important part in delivering Vihaan.AI, Air India’s comprehensive transformation and growth strategy,” highlighted Air India CEO and MD Campbell Wilson. “A core element of this transformation is the significant expansion of our network, both domestically and internationally, coupled with the elevation of our on-ground and onboard product to world-class standards. This order marks the start of a new chapter for both Airbus and Air India.” From Boeing, the carrier will acquire 220 airliners. In this case, the breakdown is 190 single-aisle and 30 wide-body aircraft. The single-aisle element of the order is composed of 737 MAXs, in an undisclosed mixture of 737-8 and 737-10 versions. The wide-body order is for 20 new-generation 787-9 Dreamliners (Air India already operates 27 787-8s) and ten 777-9 models of the 777X (the 777X is only expected to enter commercial service, with Emirates, in 2025). Air India also took options for another 50 737 MAX and 20 787-9 aeroplanes. “This acquisition of nearly 300 highly advanced Boeing jets is a core element of Vihaan.AI [which] we are pursuing at Air India,” affirmed Wilson. “These new airplanes will enable us to dramatically expand our network, both domestically and internationally, and will come with a completely new, world-class onboard product enabling passengers to travel in the highest levels of comfort and safety. With this order, we are delighted to take our long relationship with Boeing to a new level.” As a result of its order for A350-1000 airliners, Air India has also ordered 68 Trent XWB-97 engines from Rolls-Royce, and has taken options on another 20. The Trent XWB-97 is the only powerplant option for the A350-1000. Further, the carrier’s order for six A350-900s was accompanied by an order for 12 Trent XWB-84 engines, again the sole powerplant option for that airliner. “We are delighted to commence this partnership with Rolls-Royce, and to have their Trent XWB engines power our new fleet of A350 aircraft,” emphasised Wilson. “We are confident that they will provide us with the reliability and efficiency consumers expect of today’s leading airlines, and thereby play an important part in Vihaan.AI”. Air India can trace its history back to 1932, when it was founded as Tata Air Services (part of Tata & Sons – today, the Tata Group). It became Air India in 1946, and was nationalised in 1953. It was privatised in January 2022, returning to the Tata fold.
