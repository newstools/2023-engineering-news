State-owned Transnet Pipelines has selected Vopak Terminal Durban as its preferred partner to jointly bid for the Transnet National Ports Authority’s request for proposals to appoint a terminal operator for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the Port of Richards Bay. This marks an important milestone in Transnet Pipelines’ long-term growth plans and its energy transition drive from oil to gas, it avers. The two parties are working towards concluding a joint development agreement and say they look forward to a successful partnership.
