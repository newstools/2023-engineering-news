The Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Water Fund implementing partner, is launching an €8.8-million basic water and sanitation project in Kazungula, Zambia. The Zambian government, with the support and cooperation of the German government and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), is co-financing the project. The first phase of the €8.8-million grant funded project includes the construction of a new water intake structure abstracting from the Zambezi river upstream of the Kazungula Bridge; a new treatment plant; larger storage reservoirs; construction rehabilitation; and the extension of water transmission and distribution pipelines. This will significantly improve access to potable water and ensure reliability of supply to the border town, while the second and third phases will focus on improving the sanitation system. “This is a significant investment towards sustainable development of the water sector in SADC. This project highlights the importance of developmental financial partnerships in the realisation of SADC’s regional integration agenda, which seeks to provide quality water and sanitation services,” says DBSA infrastructure delivery division group executive Chuene Ramphele. “We are excited to launch the start of the construction of this regional project as it will make a positive impact on the lives of the people in Kazungula,” says German Ambassador to Botswana and Special Representative to SADC Ambassador Margi Hellwig-Boette. Zambia Ministry of Water, Development and Sanitation engineer Joe Kalusa adds that access to clean water and basic sanitation are a fundamental right and essential for good health and wellbeing.
