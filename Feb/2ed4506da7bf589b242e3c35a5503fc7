Development finance institution the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) has received approval to appoint Boitumelo Mosako as its next CEO when the incumbent Patrick Dlamini’s term comes to an end on March 31. “Mr Dlamini has been at the helm of the institution since September 2012 and his exemplary service delivered stability, strength and sustainable growth to the bank and the country,” DBSA says. “Mr. Dlamini had an impact on every single person at the DBSA. The conviction with which he led the bank over the last decade, and the institutional credibility he assisted bolster is one for the books. “And indeed, he did not do this alone, it was all possible with the support of a capable team of executives, divisional heads, managers, practitioners and experts and administration,” adds DBSA chairperson Professor Mark Swilling. The board says it identified Mosako, who is currently DBSA’s CFO, from a pool of competent candidates. She is said to have played a critical role in propelling the bank to new heights in her current role. Following Cabinet’s approval of the recommendation to appoint her, the board will, with oversight from the shareholder, manage the appointment and assumption of office. “This is an admirable feat for the bank. She is the first black woman to be recommended for this role, and we are proud that this move happened from within the bank. It is really testament to the strength of the institution, as a sanctuary for development practitioners, and we will rally behind her as she assumes her new role and meets all its critical demands,” Swilling comments. The appointment process will be finalised over the next several weeks.
