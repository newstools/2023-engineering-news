Stage 4 loadshedding will continue until 16:00 on Monday afternoon, Eskom confirmed. It will be followed by Stage 5 from 16:00 to 05:00 on Tuesday morning. Loadshedding will then be reduced to Stage 3 between 05:00 to 16:00 on both Tuesday and Wednesday. Stage 4 will be implemented during 16:00 to 05:00 on Tuesday and Wednesday. Over the past 24 hours, a generating unit each at the Arnot, Grootvlei, Kendal, Medupi and Tutuka power stations were returned to service. Breakdowns at a unit each at Camden, Majuba and Matimba power stations caused units to be taken offline for repairs. The delay in returning a unit each to service at Arnot, Hendrina, Kendal, Medupi and Tutuka power stations are contributing to the current capacity constraints. Further, electricity imports from the Cahora Bassa Hydro Scheme in Mozambique have been halved to 600 MW due to a tower failure on one of the lines from that country.
