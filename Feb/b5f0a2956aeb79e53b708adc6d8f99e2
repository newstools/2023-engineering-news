South Africa’s battery-electric vehicle portfolio continues to grow, with Volvo Car South Africa (Volvo SA) to introduce the new C40 Recharge to the local market in the third quarter of this year. The local arm of the Swedish car maker has been allocated 50 units. Volvo SA will sell the electric crossover exclusively online through the My Volvo website. The order book is open, with the vehicle clocking in at a starting price of R1.28-million. Volvo Car SA MD Greg Maruszewski says the C40 Recharge is the first Volvo model to be designed as a pure electric vehicle. It is also the first to be completely free of leather. The C40 Recharge Twin has an electric motor on each axle, resulting in peak outputs of 300 kW and 660 Nm, and allowing for zero-to-100 km/h acceleration in 4.7 seconds. The 78 kW lithium-ion battery pack offers a single-charge range of up to 444 km, dependent on conditions and driving behaviour. By 2025, Volvo aims for half of its global sales to comprise of fully electric cars, with the remaining 50% to be hybrids. By 2030, the car maker plans for all new vehicles it sells to be completely electric.
