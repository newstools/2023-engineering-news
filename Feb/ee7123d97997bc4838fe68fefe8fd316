Rand Water on Friday unveiled South Africa’s – and potentially the world’s – largest post-tensioned concrete reservoir, in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. The new 210 megalitre cylindrical and circular reservoir is being constructed at the Vlakfontein reservoir as part of Rand Water’s effort to augment its water storage. The next largest reservoir of its type is a 200 megalitre reservoir in Saudi Arabia, says Rand Water chairperson Ramateu Monyokolo during a site visit of the near completed project. The project broke ground with construction on May 12, 2020, with a completion date of April 25, 2023, expected. The Vlakfontein reservoir will supply Pretoria East, Ekurhuleni, Govan Mbeki, Victor Khanye, Thembisile Hani and Lesedi municipalities. Considered a design marvel, Rand Water CEO Sipho Mosai told delegates at the site that the newly-built reservoir adds to Vlakfontein’s existing 420 megalitre reservoir, bringing the site's total capacity to 640 megalitres, enabling a 24-hour capacity should there be any pumping challenges or power outages. The new reservoir also brings the number of Rand Water’s reservoirs to 59, with another 13 new reservoirs being built from now until 2028, increasing the agency’s capacity by 25% from the current 6 100 megalitres a day to 7 630 megalitres. This year alone, Rand Water will add 600 megalitres a day capacity, he says. Rand Water plans to spend more than R5-billion over the next five years on new projects to augment its capabilities in the provision of water.
