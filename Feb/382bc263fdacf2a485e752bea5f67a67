Namibian-registered green hydrogen development company Hyphen Hydrogen Energy has signed nonbinding memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with two major industrial companies for the supply of up to 750 000 t/y of green ammonia. The agreements are with a major chemical company and Approtium, a South Korean hydrogen producer, and entail offtake of up to 500 000 t/y and 250 000 t/y, respectively. The agreements follow Hyphen’s recent signing of an MoU with RWE Supply and Trading, or RWEST, a German multinational utility company, for supply of up to 300 000 t/y of green ammonia from 2027. Hyphen has now concluded MoUs for volumes exceeding one-million tonnes of ammonia a year. Hyphen is targeting initial production of one-million tonnes of green ammonia a year by 2027. The company plans to increase yearly production to two-million tonnes of green ammonia a year by 2029 for export to international markets, in addition to its commitments to supply and decarbonise energy domestically within Namibia and the Southern Africa region. “The conclusion of these agreements with leading players in the energy and industrial sectors marks another exciting step in Hyphen’s journey to export green hydrogen globally. Although Hyphen’s primary focus is the supply of hydrogen into Europe, and Germany in particular, South Korea is expected to emerge as a key market in the green hydrogen sector, in which Approtium will be a major player. “These partnerships with offtakers from various geographical regions firmly cement Namibia’s position as a key emerging player in the global green hydrogen industry,” avers Hyphen CEO Marco Raffinetti.
