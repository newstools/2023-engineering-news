Rand Water is preparing to implement a 30-hour planned maintenance project from 03:00 on February 24 until 09:00 on February 25. The scheduled maintenance, which will include the implementation of various cross-connections, is along Rand Waterâ€™s S1, R1 and R5 pipelines to tie-in a portion of the S4 pipeline. The S1 pipeline runs from the Mapleton Booster Pumping Station to Rynfield Vlakfontein Reservoir, while the R1 and R5 pipelines run from Rynfield to Rietvlei Nature Reserve in Tshwane. The S4 pipeline that will be tied-in runs from Van Dyk Park to Rynfield where it will cross connect to S1, R1 and R5. Municipal customers across the Ekurhuleni and Tshwane metropolitan municipalities, as well as the Thembisile Hani local municipality will experience water supply shortages during this period. Spoornet; Corobrick Transvaal; Sammy Marks Museum; Savannah Country Estate Home; and Plot 7 Benoni Agricultural Holdings will also be impacted. Rand Water says the project forms part of its previously communicated strategy to refurbish and upgrade the infrastructure for sustainability purposes. All the affected municipalities and direct customers had been notified of the planned maintenance 21 days in advance to enable them to implement their appropriate contingency measures ahead of the planned work. The affected municipalities will advise consumers on the extent of the impact of water supply shortages in their respective areas.
