The KwaZulu-Natal government is planning to establish a battery energy storage system (BESS) under power utility Eskom’s flagship BESS project, Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube said on February 24. In her State of the Province Address, she noted that the BESS would be based in Elandskop. She said the project was a partnership between Eskom and Hyosung Heavy Industries and would have the capacity to produce 8 MW equivalent to 32 MWh of distributed electricity.

“This capacity is enough to power a small town for four hours," she said.

The province will also appoint a panel of energy experts to coordinate and help accelerate the implementation of the KwaZulu-Natal Energy Master Plan By the end of March. A provincial Energy War Room, comprising of government and strategic partners, would also be established to oversee the province’s response to the national electricity crisis.
