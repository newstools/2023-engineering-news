The Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of Southern Africa (Seifsa) is conducting a loadshedding impact assessment to assist the organisation in its advocacy initiatives on energy. “South Africa’s energy crisis is having devastating consequences for the manufacturing sector. As part of quantifying this impact on the metals and engineering sector, Seifsa is conducting a short survey,” the organisation says. Seifsa says its short survey should take about eight to ten minutes to complete and that all information will be kept strictly confidential and aggregated. The closing date for the survey is February 17.
