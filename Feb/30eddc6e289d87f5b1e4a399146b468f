JSE-listed ferrous and non-ferrous alloys supplier Insimbi Holdings has decided that a smaller and more streamlined board will better suit the group, allowing for more effective fulfilment of obligations and governance responsibilities. This follows nonexecutive director Ingiphile Mogotlane’s resignation in January, following which the remuneration and nominations committee of the company reviewed the suitability of the composition and size of the board. Insimbi has made changes to the board, as well as the audit and risk and social and ethics committees, including reaching an agreement with Christiaan Coombs to step down as an executive director, effective February 6, but remaining on as CEO of the Amalgamated Metals Recycling business within the group. As of February 6, the board comprises of Frederick Botha as CEO and executive director, Nadia Winde as CFO and executive director, Robert Dickerson as chairperson and independent nonexecutive director, Nelson Mwale as nonexecutive director and Cleopatra Ntshingila as independent nonexecutive director. Mwale has also been appointed as a member of the audit and risk committee, alongside Ntshingila remaining chairperson and Dickerson remaining a member of the committee, respectively. Dickerson has also been appointed as a member of the social and ethics committee, with Ntshingila remaining chairperson and Winde remaining a member of the committee.
