eThekwini mayor Mxolisi Kaunda says rehabilitation work has started on the M4 Inkosi Albert Luthuli highway southbound carriageway.

The cost of rehabilitating the freeway, between Anton Lembede street (Smith Street) and Pascoe/Reunion road, will be just over R121-million and it is expected to take ten months to complete.

“For the city, the M4 is key because it connects the people who live in the south in areas like uMlazi, Wentworth, Isiphingo and Amanzimtoti and others to the central business district. "It also plays an important role in the growth and sustainability of the Durban harbour – Sub-Saharan Africa’s largest and busiest shipping terminal,” he comments.
