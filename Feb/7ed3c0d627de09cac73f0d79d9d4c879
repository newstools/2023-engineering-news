The City of Cape Town’s Water and Sanitation Directorate is calling on service providers to submit information and products that are commercially available to help remediate natural water bodies affected by pollution, such as estuaries, rivers, lakes and vleis. Stakeholders have until March 3 to submit their proposals to the request for information (RFI), which will evaluate a range of products for potential trial and use in natural water bodies. The RFI focuses on exploring a range of different products that are locally available and have been shown to be effective in directly addressing the issues of odour and organic sediment build-up. This emerges as the city explores a wide range of potential interventions that might improve conditions of natural water bodies affected by pollution, which will potentially be trialled at Milnerton Lagoon. “The city is serious about improving inland water quality, including at Milnerton Lagoon, and the RFI call is one of the efforts in line with this commitment,” says acting Water and Sanitation MMC Councillor Siseko Mbandezi. “This RFI call will help us understand the effectiveness of a range of products for the remediation of natural water bodies where pollution has resulted in the build-up of organic matter in the sediments.” This includes freshwater and estuarine/marine habitats. According to the RFI, the product needs to be able to assist with the breakdown of organic matter in sediments into non-toxic substances that can easily be flushed out of the water body with natural flow with no negative impact on the aquatic ecosystem. “We encourage service providers to please use this opportunity to submit their information and products which can be considered as part of the trial to help remediate Milnerton Lagoon.”
