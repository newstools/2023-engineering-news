Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) has announced a new record for imported cars handled in a month at the Durban Car Terminal in January. The terminal billed 77 297 units, exceeding the budgeted volumes by 24% and beating the 72 684-unit record set in September last year. The unprecedented volume of imported cars helped the terminal achieve its yearly target two months before the end of its financial year. TPT says it has been collaborating with customers, the industry at large and shipping lines to ensure the success of integrated planning and alignment, which has helped to improve the terminal’s ability to handle more demand. Durban Terminals managing executive Earle Peters says South African original-equipment manufacturers have been affected by global parts shortages following the onset of Covid-19, which has resulted in a backlog of imports and therefore an increase in monthly volumes.
