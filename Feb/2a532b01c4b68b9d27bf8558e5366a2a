The deadline for public comments on the Draft Bill for the National Water Resource Infrastructure Agency (NWRIA) has been extended until March 17. Gazetted on September 16, 2022, the draft initially had a deadline of December 14, calling for comments after Cabinet endorsed the Draft Bill. However, as the comment period immediately preceded the festive season, several stakeholders requested an extension and it was deemed reasonable for all stakeholders to be granted an extension to ensure that they exercise their constitutional right, says Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu. He says that the public comments exercise aim to facilitate stakeholders’ participation, raise awareness, capacity building and knowledge sharing and ensure buy-in while paving a way forward towards the formation of a State-owned entity. The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is determined to conduct a comprehensive and all-inclusive consultation process. “This entity is envisaged to undertake the building, operation, financing, and maintenance of national water resources infrastructure assets, while the DWS retains responsibility for planning, regulation, policy and price setting,” he says. The new agency seeks to ensure sustainable, equitable and reliable supply of water from the national water resources infrastructure.
