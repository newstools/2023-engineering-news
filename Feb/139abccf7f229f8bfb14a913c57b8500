Ford South Africa (SA) has started exports of the new-generation Ranger from its Silverton plant in Pretoria. The pick-up is being shipped to more than 100 markets, with Europe the largest export destination. Late last year, the Silverton plant became the third manufacturing hub across the US car maker’s International Markets Group to start production of the Ranger. The vehicle went on sale in South Africa in mid-December. “We are proud to commence with next-gen Ranger exports to customers around the world from our world-class manufacturing facility in South Africa,” says Ford SA operations VP Ockert Berry. “Having modernised local production and increased the installed capacity to a record 200 000 units a year, we remain committed to delivering quality Rangers.” Monthly export volumes from Ford’s operations in South Africa are expected to reach around two-thirds of total production, with these units to move through the Durban and Gqeberha ports. The two-port strategy is essential for what Ford expects to be higher export volumes for the new model, with the Gqeberha route set to play a more instrumental role once a more efficient and reliable rail corridor between Gauteng and the Eastern Cape has been established. “We…continue to work with authorities to address bottlenecks such as the high level of congestion at Durban’s roll-on roll-off vehicle terminal, as well as the lack of rail infrastructure for Ford to direct most of its exports, as well as imports, through Gqeberha,” says Berry.
