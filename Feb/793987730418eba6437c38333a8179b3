The lake levels at Kariba dam, which have been in recession in the last quarter of 2022, have been rising steadily following the onset of rains on and around the lake and Zambezi River upper catchment. The year started with a low lake level of 475.61 m, or 0.83% of live storage available for power generation. By February 16, the level had increased to 476.85 m, with six-billion cubic metres of stored usable water, or 9.32% of live storage, and 1.35 m above minimum operating level of 475.50 m. This translates to a rise of 1.24 m since January 1 and an increase from the lowest record of 475.60 m, 10 cm above the minimum operating level recorded on December 30, 2022, the Zambezi River Authority said in its first update for 2023.

The flows were reported as receding and oscillating around 1 538 m3/s as at February 16, higher than the flows of 1 192 m3/s reported in February 2022.
