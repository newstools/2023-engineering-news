The Road Traffic Infringement Agency (RTIA) says the appointment of Matsemela Moloi as registrar and CEO, effective March 1, has been confirmed by Cabinet. He has been serving as acting RTIA registrar since February last year when he was seconded from the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) to guide the agency in terms of governance and accountability. In his new role, Moloi is tasked with providing stability to RTIA to enable it to achieve its core mandate of enhanced road safety through the implementation of the Administrative Adjudication of Road Traffic Offences Act, which aims to discourage the contravention of road traffic laws and compliance. The RTIA says Moloi has “extensive” experience and has held several senior government positions and is “well-versed” in the public sector, traffic management and the transportation industry. With several degrees and diplomas, including an MA and an MBA, he served as an executive mayor and also held management positions at a provincial and national level. The RTIA says Moloi has “broad” experience in management and, in particular, in road safety. “In his tenure as acting registrar, we have come to appreciate his dedication to creating an environment of accountability, transparency and growth. “We are gratified to have him on board on a permanent basis and look forward to a successful term and fruitful working relationship,” says RTIA chairperson Bongekile Zulu.
