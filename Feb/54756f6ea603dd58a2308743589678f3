Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha, who joined Eskom on a fixed-term contract three years ago, will be leaving Eskom at the end of February. Mantshantsha had agreed to join Eskom as spokesperson to lead the Media Desk during a difficult period in which the organisation needed to restore trust and credibility in its dealings with the public and stakeholders. Eskom says that, over the course of three years, Mantshantsha helped improve the utility's public image by driving honest and frank communication in the media domain on Eskom’s real position during a difficult period characterised by operating difficulties and increased loadshedding. This has seen Eskom become more accountable, agile and transparent in its external positioning, while increasing its share of voice with regular executive team briefings to the public on key developments. “Sikonathi has been the catalyst in Eskom improving transparency and frequency of information sharing, dealing with several difficult media engagements during his tenure. “Eskom is grateful for his contribution to our organisation, and we wish him well during his next journey,” comments Eskom interim CEO Calib Cassim. In the interim, Daphne Mokwena will lead the Media Desk team and act as Eskom group spokesperson with immediate effect while the recruitment process for a permanent spokesperson is under way. Mokwena is currently the senior manager for retail centre of excellence and has been in the employ of Eskom for 21 years. Among others, she has served as the Gauteng customer services senior manager and Gauteng distribution spokesperson dealing with challenging issues such as Soweto debt.
