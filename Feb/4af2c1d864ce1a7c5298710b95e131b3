Stage 3 loadshedding will be implemented until 16:00 on Tuesday, after which Stage 4 will be rolled out until 16:00 on Wednesday. Stage 5 loadshedding will then be implemented from 16:00 until 05:00 on Thursday, with Stage 4 loadshedding from 05:00 until 16:00. This pattern will occur until further notice, Eskom said on Tuesday. This comes after a generating unit each at Camden, Kriel, Matla and Matimba were returned to service in the last 24 hours - but breakdowns at a unit each at Duvha, Lethabo, Majuba and Tutuka caused units to be taken offline. There have been delays in returning units to service at Arnot, Camden, Duvha and Kendal. Currently 19 031 MW are out on breakdowns, while another 4 174MW are out on planned maintenance.
