The inaugural Made in the Cape 2023 expo aims to ramp up support for Western Cape exporters, with 30 buyers from around the globe gathering in Cape Town in the first three days of March to meet with more than 300 exporters. The 30 buyers from 18 different countries around the world have been pre-vetted, with the exporters pre-selected by buyers via the digital Cape Trade Portal. Among the buyers are New York's Wine for the World, Cameroon’s DOVV Distribution SARL, and SAFCO International, from the United Arab Emirates. "Our goal as the city government is to build a stronger, more resilient and inclusive economy,” says Cape Town Economic Growth MMC James Vos. “Increasing export opportunities by connecting local producers with international buyers via Made in the Cape 2023 directly speaks to this goal. “I'm also pleased to see that the Cape Trade Portal is delivering such excellent results because, as a city, we have motivated for a platform that will make market access easier for local businesses. “I look forward to seeing more Cape products in markets across the globe.” “Cape Town and the Western Cape is a sought-after source market on the African continent,” adds Wesgro CEO Wrenelle Stander. “Pioneering smart ways for increased market access will continue to be a focus for Wesgro in 2023, increasing our competitiveness and global footprint.” The ‘Made in the Cape’ brand was launched in the UK, driving buyers to the Cape Trade Portal, as well as encouraging local exporters to expand their global footprint through registering on the virtual marketplace free of charge. Following the UK success, Wesgro chief marketing and innovation officer Jean Scheltema says the highly targeted digital campaign is currently running in the US market, with 42 000 clicks already achieved to the Cape Trade Portal.
