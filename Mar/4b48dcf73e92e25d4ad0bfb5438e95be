Dual-listed energy developer Kibo Energy has appointed Peter Oldacre as business development executive. The company says in a statement released on March 10 that Oldacre’s impressive credentials distinguish him as an experienced renewable energy and energy storage project developer with deep technical, financial and commercial experience. He has worked in various businesses in the energy, renewables, minerals, investments and global corporate markets. Particularly, Kibo believes Oldacre’s experience in blended finance, international project finance and investment and equity sourcing can add value to the company. In his new role, Oldacre will be responsible for the development, management and execution of appropriate plans to implement Kibo’s business development strategy, from the feasibility stage of projects through to construction completion. Almost all the projects in Kibo’s portfolio are currently in the development phase, and comprise multi-asset energy projects in sub-Saharan Africa and the UK.
