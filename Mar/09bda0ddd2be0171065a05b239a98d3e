Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution company Petregaz will acquire all 35 LPG trucks, tankers and truck horses from road logistics services provider OneLogix, with effect from April 1. Through the acquisition of these assets, Petregaz will be able to expand its supply chain capabilities, provide primary logistics services to a larger client base and work closer with its existing and potential new key clients across the LPG industry, the company said. “The addition of these assets to our business together with a focus on a high standard of service delivery will significantly enhance our logistical capabilities which are key to the reliable supply of LPG in Southern Africa,” said Petregaz MD Matthew Costello. Petregaz is a subsidiary of the Petredec Group. “We will build on key focus areas including security of supply of LPG in Southern Africa as well as provide supply chain excellence to Petregaz’s valued existing and potential new clients,” he added. “OneLogix firmly believes the sale of our LPG division to Petregaz will result in enhanced service delivery given Petregaz’s extensive experience, infrastructure and customer base. The transaction also reduces OneLogix’s risk profile following its recent delisting,” commented OneLogix CEO Cameron McCulloch.
