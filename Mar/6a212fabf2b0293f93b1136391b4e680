Tyres produced locally by tyre manufacturer Goodyear South Africa have been certified as Proudly South African by the buy local advocacy campaign. “The certification means Goodyear’s tyres that are pressed out of the company’s manufacturing plant in Kariega, in the Eastern Cape, are deemed as meeting local content thresholds and, more importantly, quality standards,” the manufacturer says. The certification serves to note that Goodyear is currently the only tyre manufacturer that produces off-the-road bias tyres in South Africa. Off-the-road bias tyres are fitted on heavy-duty vehicles, such as mining vehicles, which are vital to the daily operations of mines in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent, it adds. “At Goodyear, we understand that local production is an important driver of our country’s economy and job creation for our people. Having Goodyear tyres manufactured in the Kariega plant certified Proudly South African is a huge milestone in our 75-year presence in the country and is another demonstration of our commitment to the economic development of South Africa,” says Goodyear South Africa MD Richard Fourie. Goodyear takes great pride in its role as a key contributor to the South African automotive industry and economy for 75 years and counting. The first Goodyear tyre produced in South Africa rolled off the press in 1948. Goodyear has grown to employ more than 1 000 employees in South Africa and produces more than two-million tyres a year in the country, he points out. As an organisation created to promote local industries and products, Proudly South African is pleased to see that one more multinational is committed to the sustainable development of South Africa’s manufacturing industry, says Proudly South African CEO Eustace Mashimbye. “We welcome Goodyear to the Buy Local movement and look forward to a fruitful association as we continue with our localisation efforts as the country’s buy local campaign,” he adds.
