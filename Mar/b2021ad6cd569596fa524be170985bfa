From Creamer Media in Johannesburg, this is the Real Economy Report. Sashnee Moodley: Rand Water has unveiled a new 210 megalitre post-tensioned concrete reservoir in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, deemed to be the largest of its type in South Africa. Natasha Odendaal tells us more. Natasha Odendaal: Construction on the new cylindrical and circular reservoir at the Vlakfontein site, as part of Rand Water’s effort to augment its water storage, broke ground on May 12, 2020, with a completion date of April 25, 2023, expected. It is believed to be the largest reservoir of its type, with the next largest a 200 megalitre reservoir in Saudi Arabia. Rand Water chairperson Ramateu Monyokolo: Natasha Odendaal: Considered a design marvel, the newly built reservoir adds to Vlakfontein’s existing 420 megalitre reservoir, bringing the site’s total capacity to 630 megalitre, enabling a 24-hour capacity should there be any pumping challenges or power outages. Rand Water CEO Sipho Mosai: Natasha Odendaal: The extensive work carried out by Rand Water in Gauteng and other parts of the country, said that the construction of the reservoir formed part of measures put into place by the Rand Water’s strategies of refurbishing and augmenting water infrastructure. The new Vlakfontein reservoir brings the number of Rand Water’s reservoirs to 59, with another 13 new reservoirs being built, increasing the agency’s capacity by 25% from the current 6 100 megalitres a day to 7 630 megalitres.
