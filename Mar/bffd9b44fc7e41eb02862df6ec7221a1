JSE-listed Tongaat Hulett says the recent rains and flooding caused by tropical cyclone Freddy has had an impact on the companyâ€™s Mozambique sugar operations. The extent of the damage has yet to be determined owing to high water levels across the Xinavane Estate. The impact on the Mafambisse Estate is said to be minimal. Further announcements will be made once further details and information become available, the company says. This is another blow for the group, whose South African operations are under business rescue.
