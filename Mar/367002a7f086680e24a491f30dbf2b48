Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan has dismissed what he called “unfounded allegations” by Good Party secretary general Brett Herron that he goes around the Eskom CEO and board to liaise directly with Eskom officials. Herron gave a television interview where he discussed the country’s energy crisis in the country and raised the allegations of Gordhan by-passing Eskom leadership. On Monday night President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopa Electricity Minister as the recurring power cuts cause massive disruption of the country’s economy. Gordhan hit back against the allegations and said he did not micromanage employees at the power utility. He stressed that his department would hold Eskom’s board and management to account. He further warned Herron to avoid joining the “echo chamber” created to distract from the real reasons why the coal-powered plants were underperforming. “Mr Herron has made unfounded allegations against me without offering any substance to his allegations. His attempt at analysis was poor at best and imaginative at worst. I condemn these unfounded allegations with contempt,” he said. He went further to note that the Department of Public Enterprises, as the shareholder representative on behalf of government with oversight responsibility over six State-owned enterprises (SOEs), was required in terms of the Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) between the department and the SOEs to seek clarity and more information on the challenges facing entities. He said his discussion with the boards of SOEs, including executive management, were guided by good corporate governance principles and MOIs signed between his department and the SOEs. He added that his department would continue to put pressure on Eskom to do whatever it takes to reduce loadshedding.
