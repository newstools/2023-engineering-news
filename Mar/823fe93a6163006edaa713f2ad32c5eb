Engineering News editor Terence Creamer discusses the revelations that came to light during Eskom's centenary events, including warnings by the Eskom management of 1997 that the country was facing an electricity supply shortfall and that the debt owed to Eskom by municipalities was already becoming a significant challenge. He also talks about how loadshedding and allegations of ongoing criminality had overshadowed the centenary celebrations and the slow pace with which government is moving to deal with the country's energy crisis despite having declared a state of disaster.
