Solar park operator and owner AEP Energy will be advancing its global expansion plans at this year’s Africa Energy Indaba (AEI) by showcasing its unique mobile solar container, the MooV Solar. The MooV Solar container boasts a capacity of between 90 kW and 150 kW, depending on the end-user’s requirements, and is fully mobile, making it a cost-effective and instant solution for a range of industries including disaster response, military use, industrial applications, agricultural production and public power suppliers. “The unique feature of the device is the mobility at almost the same cost as for fixed installations,” the company says. The official launch for international sales will be at AEI 2023. AEP Energy, which has largely operated and owned solar parks in the EU, is looking to invest in solar projects in Africa as well as globally, and is considering joint ventures and investment opportunities to advance these plans. The company is also interested in working closely with African public entities and the private sector. Another of AEP Energy's innovations is its replacement of batteries with hydrogen storage, making it fully environment-friendly. While details about the process cannot be released, the company says that it will supply innovative development chains and engineer solutions according to customer needs. In addition, AEP Energy is planning a real exposé at the agriculture show in Casablanca, Morocco, in May, subject to permission being granted. The company aims to supply power for the show, making it the first showcase to be supplied by solar power in the world. AEP Energy is committed to providing sustainable energy solutions to industries and individuals globally, and its latest developments demonstrate its dedication to this cause, it says. “Our innovations are set to revolutionize the energy sector, and our global expansion plans will ensure that more people have access to renewable energy sources,” the company concludes.
