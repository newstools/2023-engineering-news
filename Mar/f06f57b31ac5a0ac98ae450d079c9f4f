The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) says it will carry out blasting to remove rock outcrops near the Camperdown Overpass bridge at 14:00 on Tuesday March 14 for the construction of the stormwater system, as well as pavement layers. This forms part of the ongoing N3 upgrades from the Cato Ridge Interchange to the northern end of the Dardanelles Cutting. Temporary road closures in the vicinity of the Overpass Bridge will be put in place on the R103. The onramps at Cato Ridge Interchange and Camperdown Interchange will be temporarily closed during the blast. The road closures should, however, not delay traffic for more than ten minutes. “All road closures will be immediately removed as soon as the site of blasting has been declared safe. Should a second blasting procedure be required, this will be carried out at 14:00 on March 16,” Sanral Eastern Region project manager Thabiso Dladla says. Further, the speed limit along the route has been reduced to 80 km/h to improve safety of the construction team and road users. Lane closures can be expected in the evening to permit construction vehicles to safely enter and exit the work zone, and the public will be informed in advance of such activity. Delays are expected, as a result of the reduced speed limit, so motorists are urged to plan their trips carefully and be vigilant along the road during their travels. “We appeal to road users to adhere to the road signs and speed limit when approaching and travelling through the construction site. Sanral apologises for any inconvenience this may cause and asks for your understanding as we make the necessary upgrades,” says Dladla.
