Toyota South Africa Motors (TSAM) has retained its number one position in the South African new-vehicle market in 2022, posting its forty-third straight year as the market leader. This comes despite the company’s Durban plant closing its doors in April last year owing to severe flooding, and only reopening fully in August. The plant assembles the Corolla Cross, Fortuner, Hiace Ses’fikile minibus and Hilux models, as well as Hino trucks. TSAM sold 132 035 vehicles in the South African market in 2022, recording a market share of 24.9%. The company in 2021 achieved a market share of 25.4%, selling 117 659 units. TSAM’s 12.2% growth in sales in 2022 lags only marginally behind the industry’s total sales expansion of 13.9% for the year. “We are grateful to the entire TSAM team and dealers across the country for their continued efforts towards making Toyota a market leader, but we have learned from last year that we cannot be complacent,” says TSAM sales and marketing senior VP Leon Theron. “We emerged out of a tragedy and managed to achieve an overall market share of 24.9% in 2022 – and that’s phenomenal. “Our mandate this year is to continue making Toyota, Lexus and Hino the brands of choice for our market. We will achieve this by constantly aligning ourselves with customer needs.”
