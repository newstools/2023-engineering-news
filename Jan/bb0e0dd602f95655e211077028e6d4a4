Hong Kong airline Cathay Pacific announced on Monday that it was going to resume direct flights between the Chinese territory and South Africa. The service will restart on August 2, and be operated three times a week, with Johannesburg being the South African terminal. “We are eager to not only welcome our customers from South Africa to experience our warm Asian culture, but also the comfort and efficiency when travelling onboard the Airbus A350-900,” highlights Cathay Pacific regional marketing and sales head: South Asia, Middle East and Africa Anand Yedery. “With the removal of travel restrictions into Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, and with our connections to popular Asian destinations, we can aid customers to fulfil all their travel plans – whether it is to reunite with their loved ones or take that much-awaited holiday or for business.” The flights will depart Hong Kong on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays, at 00h40. Their flight code will be CX 749. Their scheduled time of arrival in Johannesburg will be at 07h35. The return flights to Hong Kong, coded CX 748, will depart on those same days, at 11h20, arriving in Hong Kong at 06h00 the next day, local time (remember the time zone difference). Seats can be booked through the airline’s own website or through its “travel partners”. The airline’s A350-900s are configured with 280 seats in three classes. These are business class (38 seats), premium economy class (28 seats) and economy class (214 seats). The airline notes that the A350-900 has an “extra-wide” cabin, an innovative inflight entertainment system and inflight connectivity. Cathay Pacific highlighted that the A350-900 is a cutting-edge design with the latest aerodynamic refinements, innovative design and technology, and fuel-efficiency. This both improves passenger comfort and reduces the aircraft’s climate impact. It is the airline’s policy to reduce its climate impact by continuing to acquire younger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.
