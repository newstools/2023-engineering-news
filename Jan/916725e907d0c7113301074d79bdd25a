Sub-Saharan African investment company Arise has appointed Philip Odera chairperson, with effect from January 15, 2023, after Nhlanhla Nene retired from the board. Odera, who hails from Kenya, boasts a career in financial services that spans more than three decades, with 17 years in country leadership roles for Stanbic Bank Africa. He has served as the CEO of Stanbic Bank Kenya, Stanbic Bank South Sudan, Stanbic Bank Uganda and Standard Bank Malawi. Odera was also the deputy MD of Stanbic Bank Tanzania and Citibank DRC CEO. He is currently the managing partner of East African advisory services company Marr Consult, and he chairs the boards of Liberty Kenya Holdings and Botswana-based Letshego Holdings. “Philip brings significant industry expertise to the Arise board. His extensive experience and knowledge of the African financial services sector will play an important role in the next phase of the company’s growth as it works to grow its investment portfolio and deliver on its mandate of spurring economic activity on the African continent. We look forward to working with Philip,” says Arise CEO Gavin Tipper. Nene joined the board shortly after the formation of Arise and, with the exception of a short period when he returned to politics, led the board through an important period of growth. He agreed to extend his initial term on the board to guide the company through both the Covid-19 period and several changes at senior management level. "On behalf of Arise, I extend our appreciation to Nhlanhla for his counsel and commitment. During his tenure, Arise made significant strides in delivering on its mission of advancing financial inclusion in Africa. We wish him the greatest success in his future endeavours,” says Tipper.
