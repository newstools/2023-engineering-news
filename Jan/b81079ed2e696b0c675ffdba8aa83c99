Amid crippling loadshedding across the country, the Democratic Alliance (DA) will head to the High Court to interdict the 18.6% electricity tariff hike that was recently granted by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to Eskom last week. DA leader John Steenhuisen said South Africans, who have already had to spend a third of 2022 in darkness and are burdened with indefinite Stage 6 load-shedding, are now expected to also pay for the looting and mismanagement of Eskom through exorbitant tariff increases. He argues that electricity tariffs have already increased by more than 650% since the energy crisis started in 2007, which is quadruple the inflation rate over the same period. The DA’s lawyers will ask the High Court to have Nersa’s decision be declared inconsistent with the Constitution of South Africa, declared invalid, and to have it set aside. The party also wants loadshedding to be declared inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore invalid, and to have these decisions set aside. The interdict will also try to have the government’s response to the ongoing energy crisis declared inconsistent with the Constitution and invalid. “To have government’s response to the crisis declared as having failed to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the rights in the Bill of Rights, thereby limiting the right to human dignity, the right to life, the right to an environment that is not harmful to health and well-being, the right of access to healthcare services, the right to access sufficient water, the right to basic education, and the right to access courts,” Steenhuisen said. The party will also ask that the court direct government to file, within 30 days, a comprehensive plan, including short-term, medium-term and long-term steps, to avert the energy crisis. Steenhuisen also invited South Africans to join his party on a march against the ongoing energy crisis to the African National Congress headquaters in Luthuli House in January 25.
