Europe-based global major aerospace group Airbus has released its commercial aircraft deliveries and order totals for last year. Deliveries totalled 661 airliners to 84 customers. (This total excludes two A350-900 widebody airliners recorded in December 2021 as having been sold to Russian carrier Aeroflot, but which could not be delivered owing to sanctions imposed on Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine.) The figure for 2021 had been 611. “In 2022 we served 84 customers with 661 deliveries, an increase of 8% compared to 2021,” noted Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury. “That’s obviously less than we were targeting but given the complexity of the operating environment I want to thank the teams and our partners for the hard work and the ultimate result.” In terms of new orders, gross new orders last year came to 1 078, with net new orders totalling 820. These orders were spread across all the company’s programmes and in all its market segments. “The significant order intake covering all our aircraft families, including freighters, reflects the strength and competitiveness of our product line,” he said. As of December 31, 2022, the company’s order backlog stood at 7 239 aircraft. “We continue our [production] ramp-up trajectory to deliver on our backlog,” he assured. Last year, in the single-aisle airliner category, Airbus delivered 53 A220-family aircraft (Airbus’s smallest airliners), up from 50 in 2021, and 516 A320-family aircraft (2021: 483). In the widebody category, deliveries came to 32 for the A330-family (as against 18 in 2021) and 60 for the A350-family (2021: 55). Deliveries of the A380 Superjumbo fell to zero last year, having numbered five in 2021; production of this type has been ended. In terms of gross new orders last year, the A220-family won 127 and the A320neo- (new engine option-) family gained 888. Airbus’ widebody airliners won 63 gross new orders, divided into 19 for the A330-family and 44 for the A350-family. The latter figure included 24 gross orders for the newly-launched A350F freighter version.
