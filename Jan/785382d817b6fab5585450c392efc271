The airspace over and around Somalia was reclassified as Class A at one minute past midnight on Thursday morning. This marked the operational restoration of air traffic control (ATC) services in Somalia and the adjacent airspace over the Indian Ocean – formally known as the Mogadishu Flight Information Region (FIR) – for the first time in 30 years. Busy airways linking Africa south of Ethiopia to the Middle East and South Asia, and connecting Europe with South Asia and the Indian Ocean islands, pass through the Mogadishu FIR. Consequently, this development has been welcomed by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which is the representative body of the global airline industry. “The reclassification of the Mogadishu FIR as ‘Class A’ airspace will significantly improve safety in the region and enhance efficiency,” highlighted IATA regional VP: Middle East and Africa Kamil Al-Awadhi. “This is thanks to the collaborative efforts of the Somalia Airspace Special Coordination Team, comprising the Somali CAA [Civil Aviation Authority], IATA, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, adjacent FIRs and airlines.” The reclassification of Somali airspace and the operational restoration of ATC was enabled by the establishment and commissioning of modern technological infrastructure, not least radio navigation systems. And it followed a successful trial period, which started last May. In the case of Somalia, Class A airspace starts at an altitude of about 24 500 ft (nearly 7 500 m) above mean sea level and extends upwards. All flights in that airspace must be cleared by Somali ATC, which must also ensure that aircraft in this airspace maintain the proper separation, both laterally and vertically. “The upgrade of air traffic management and improved navigation and communication infrastructure will enhance situational awareness along an increasingly busy air corridor and its intersections with routes linking many of the world’s regions,” he pointed out.
