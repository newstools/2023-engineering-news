South Africa and Türkiye have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to facilitate cooperation in science, technology and innovation (STI) between the two countries. The MoU was signed by South African Higher Education, Science and Innovation Minister Dr Blade Nzimande and Türkiye Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, in Pretoria. But while the South African Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation announced the establishment of the MoU on Friday, the actual signing ceremony had taken place last Tuesday. No reason for the delay in the announcement was given. “Both South Africa and [Türkiye] recognise the importance of science and technology in the development of their respective national economies, and the ability of [STI] to improve the standard of living of communities,” highlighted the Ministry in its statement. “The partnership will promote inter-institutional cooperation, exchange of scientists, researchers, technical experts, scholars, joint research, as well as the exchange of science, innovation and technological policy information in advancing science diplomacy between the two countries.” The Ministry added that Nzimande believed that the partnership would benefit both parties. He specifically referred to the spheres of capacity building, the development of scholarly STI cooperation and joint research. The Ministry further pointed out that the two countries had maintained a “strategic” relationship since 1991. This covered political, economic and cultural relations. The signing of the MoU, it said, would deepen bilateral relations. Trade between the two countries had, in recent years, experienced a “gradual” increase. But, the Ministry cited, in the period from April to November last year, South African exports to Türkiye had risen by about 18%.
