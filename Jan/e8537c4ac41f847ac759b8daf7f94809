Peer-to-peer ride-hailing platform inDriver says all inDriver application (app) users in South Africa can use the service without incurring mobile data costs, as the company will cover the cost for all mobile data that users consume when using the app. “Owing to our partnership with mobile operator MTN, we can provide people with the opportunity to use our service to the fullest, offer and receive the services they need at fair prices and not worry about needing Wi-Fi to use it,” says inDriver business development representative Vincent Lilane. inDriver covers the use of data costs of four telecommunications operators, whose combined market share in South Africa is 99%. The company currently operates in nine cities of South Africa, namely Cape Town, Durban, East London, Gqeberha, Johannesburg, Pietermaritzburg, Polokwane, Pretoria and Rustenburg. The service operates based on a peer-to-peer pricing principle, which allows passengers and drivers to directly negotiate a fare. inDriver became the first ride-sharing app in South Africa that made the use of mobile data free for its users, an unprecedented case in the country, he adds.
