Telecommunications giant MTN Group president and CEO Ralph Mupita has called for the modernisation and harmonisation of regulatory frameworks across Africa as well as the collective effort of all stakeholders to ensure that the continent can deliver universal broadband coverage by 2030. Speaking during the Africa Prosperity Dialogue, held at Peduase in the Eastern Region of Ghana over the weekend, he said that the regulatory frameworks for Africa’s telecommunications industry did not reflect the continent’s current advancement, as they were still positioned for the era of voice. “As the world continues to undergo major digital transformation and disruption, our regulatory frameworks need to evolve to reflect these technological advancements,” he added in his address on ‘Moving from Ambition to Action: The Role of Telecommunications in Deepening Intra-African Trade, Challenges and Opportunity’. There was a need for a robust regulatory framework which was relevant and future-fit. Further, there was a need for all local and international participants in the sector, including mobile network operators and over-the-top players, to contribute to building and investing in infrastructure, he said, pointing out that Africa needed around $100-billion in capital investment to reach its goal of universal broadband for all Africans by 2030. The Africa Prosperity Dialogue was attended by several distinguished African leaders, including Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo and former Niger President and Africa Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) champion Issofou Mohamadou, besides many others. The Africa Prosperity Dialogue, organised by the Africa Prosperity Network, aims to achieve deeper economic integration between African States in outlining its industrialisation priorities. Among topics under discussion were the policies that would ensure the successful implementation of the AfCFTA.
