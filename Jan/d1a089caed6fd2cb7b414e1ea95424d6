Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Minister Barbara Creecy will be visiting the Princess Elisabeth Antarctic Research Station for four days starting January 9. The visit is being hosted by the Belgium government and the International Polar Foundation, as the operator of the research station. Creecy will have the opportunity to learn more about the first zero-emissions research station in Antarctica during the visit. The station has become a showcase for best practice in the use of renewable energies to reduce the environmental impact of operations on Antarctica. The Belgian Polar Secreteriat and other government officials have expressed their desire to share best practice with Creecy, in efforts to improve the environmental performance of the South African research infrastructure in Antarctica. The South African Antarctic Programme’s research station, known as SANAE, in Queen Maud Land, was built in 1961, with South Africa having maintained an uninterrupted presence in the Antarctic since then. South Africa’s research has contributed to the management and conservation of Antarctica, as well as the pool of scientific knowledge available on the continent. The scientific data that is collected from the research station is particularly critical in understanding the impacts of climate change and weather.
