Eskom has postponed outgoing CEO André de Ruyter's planned briefing on Monday evening due to an emergency meeting with President Cyril Ramaphosa. "Unfortunately Eskom has had to postpone this afternoon’s media briefing due to emergency engagements with the President," spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said in a statement. "While we aim to hold the media briefing as soon as possible, the date and time can only be confirmed once meetings with the President are concluded." Ramaphosa cancelled his trip to the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) gathering in Davos, Switzerland this week to deal with SA's energy crisis. Ramaphosa is also expected to meet leaders of political parties represented in parliament and the National Energy Crisis Committee (NECCOM). There were 200 days of loadshedding in 2022, and cuts every day this year, including an on-going six day stretch of Stage 6. Eskom is expected to announce an update on the loadshedding situation later on Monday.
