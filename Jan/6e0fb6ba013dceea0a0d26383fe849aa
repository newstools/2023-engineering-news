The Competition Tribunal has appointed three preeminent senior counsel who will serve as members. The appointments comprise advocates Geoff Budlender, Jerome Wilson and Tembeka Ngcukaitobi. The senior counsel are recognised as leading experts in their areas of practice and will join the tribunal from January, February and April, respectively. Tribunal chairperson Mondo Mazwai says the adjudicative body welcomes the three accomplished and respected lawyers, as they bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise that will enhance the tribunal’s capacity. The tribunal is in the process of developing new jurisprudence under the Competition Amendment Act, which became effective in 2019, with which the new experts can assist. The new members will serve on a part-time basis and help to advise on points of law during decision-making processes. Particularly, Budlender is versed in constitutional law, including human rights and administrative law, with extensive litigation experience at the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Appeal and High Courts. In turn, Wilson is an experienced advocate at the Johannesburg Bar, practicing in the areas of competition, commercial and administrative law. Notably, Wilson has litigation experience in local appeal courts as well as in Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Ngcukaitobi is also working at the Johannesburg Bar, specialising in competition, labour, commercial and constitutional law. He has extensive litigation experience in the Competition Appeal Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal.
