The South African National Roads Agency Limited (Sanral) says toll fees at the N2 uThongati and uMvoti toll plazas will be reinstated from February 1, following the completion of repairs to flood-damaged infrastructure on the R102 and M4 near the plazas. However, while toll collection will resume on the N2 uThongati Mainline and North Ramps and N2 uMvoti Mainline and all ramps for all vehicles, toll fees on the N2 uThongati South Ramps will remain suspended until access along the M4 uThongati River Bridge has been restored, it added in a January 11 statement. In April, Sanral had suspended toll fees at these plazas to ease the economic burden on communities already hard hit by loss of property and livelihoods as a result of the devastating floods that swept through KwaZulu-Natal at the time. The R102 and M4 were alternative routes to the toll plazas, but were so badly damaged that road users were compelled to use the uThongati and uMvoti toll plazas on the N2 to get around, it explained. “Our contractors have been working around the clock to repair damaged infrastructure and restore access to the R102 and M4. Both these roads are now fully open to traffic and access to the uThongathi River Bridge is imminent. We wish to thank road users for their patience during this time and wish them safe travels,” said Sanral eastern region manager Dumisani Nkabinde.
