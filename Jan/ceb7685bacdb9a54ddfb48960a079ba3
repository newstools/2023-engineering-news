The City of Tshwane (CoT) has been coming up short on its payments to Eskom for several months and it owes the State-owned power utility R1.4-billion as of January 25. Eskom has announced that CoT short-paid its November 2022 bill of R660-million and failed to pay its December 2022 account of R780-million entirely. After declaring a dispute, the utility has now approached the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) to mediate in the resolution of CoT’s poor payment record in recent months. Eskom says it does not have the financial capacity to finance the CoT’s operations and calls on the city to do right by its residents and pay the bulk electricity account that is due, lest Eskom may need to cut supply to the city.
