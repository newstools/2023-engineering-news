Giant US aerospace group Boeing has reported its totals for commercial aircraft deliveries and orders during last year. Total deliveries last year came to 480, including 44 freighter versions of the company’s airliner families. “We worked hard in 2022 to stabilise 737 production, resume 787 deliveries, launch the 777-8 Freighter and, most importantly, meet our customer commitments,” reported Boeing Commercial Airplanes president and CEO Stan Deal. “As the airline industry expands its recovery, we are seeing strong demand across our product family, particularly the highly efficient 737 MAX and the 787 Dreamliner.” Deliveries of single-aisle 737 airliners came to 374, all of which were of the latest generation MAX family. (In addition, 13 military aircraft based on 737 New Generation – that is, the generation before the MAX – airframes were delivered.) Widebody airliner deliveries totalled 93. These comprised five 747s, 33 767s, 24 777s and 31 787s. Of these totals, 69 were delivered in December alone. This figure was subdivided into 53 737 MAXs and 16 widebodies. Gross orders won totalled 935, with net orders (following cancellations and order conversions) coming to 774. These net orders were composed of 561 for the 737 family and 213 of the company’s widebody types. The group’s commercial aircraft order backlog stood, on December 31, 2022, at 4 578. “We will stay focused on driving stability within our operations and the supply chain as we work to deliver for our customers in 2023 and beyond,” he assured.
