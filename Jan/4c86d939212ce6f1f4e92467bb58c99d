Uthingo Mills KwaZulu-Natal, a black female owned business, officially launched its maize meal product at the weekend. The maize meal company is currently contracted by Spar Group to provide Uthingo Maize to Spar shops, including those in Indanda, KwaMashu Bridge, Empangeni, Hluhluwe and Mtubatuba.

The launch of Uthingo Mills was made possible by the Ithala Development Finance Corporation – one of KwaZulu-Natal’s primary drivers of economic development and a strategic enabler of support for, in particular, the province’s historically disadvantaged communities.

“In essence, we actively promote a culture of entrepreneurship within the communities with which we interact. We have a range of financial solution packages designed to stimulate the spirit of entrepreneurship, promote job creation in the province, while also being responsible for extending to clients non-financial business support mechanisms to ensure business sustainability and empowerment.” Uthingo reputation manager Sithandiwe Dambi said. Uthingo Mills CEO Nontetho Mathe is excited that the company's products are now available in all sizes and combos at Spar shops.

“It has been a long journey for us to get here but the support from Ithala, which we are grateful for, has made it possible.” said Mathe.
