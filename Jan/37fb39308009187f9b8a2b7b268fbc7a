Contract mining firm Moolmans, which is a subsidiary of JSE-listed Aveng, has entered into a new five-year contract, valued at about R7-billion, with its long-standing client and South African manganese miner Tshipi é Ntle. This contract award will result in significant investment in equipment, people, processes and systems and is firmly aligned with Aveng’s goal of ensuring a fit-for-purpose organisation capable of sustainable and profitable long-term growth, says Aveng. Moolmans, with the support of Tshipi é Ntle, has placed an order for 16 new Cat 785D trucks, five of which are already on site and awaiting commissioning. The remaining 11 trucks are expected to be fully operational by June. Additionally, two new Liebherr excavators and four new bulldozers are on back order, together with an existing Liebherr excavator undergoing a full original-equipment manufacturer refurbishment. The award of this contract signifies a key strategic milestone for Moolmans, which is actively selecting and entering into long-term and commercially viable contracts, coupled with the necessary investment in heavy mining equipment. Tshipi é Ntle mines manganese in the Northern Cape. Moolmans has been providing contract mining services to Tshipi é Ntle since 2011.
