Natural gas and helium producer Renergen has produced its first liquid helium at its flagship Virginia gas project, in South Africa’s Free State province, making the country the world’s newest producer of liquid helium. The helium module is now operational and being optimised, the company confirmed on January 23. "Having the helium plant in operation and producing liquid helium is a truly spectacular achievement by the team who went above and beyond to achieve the major and critical milestone. “All components of the Phase 1 plant are now in operation and South Africa joins the ranks of only 8 countries in the world to produce this rare and valuable liquid," says CEO Stefano Marani.
