The portfolio committees on Public Enterprises, and Mineral Resources and Energy and the Select Committee on Public Enterprises and Communication will, on Thursday and Friday, meet various Eskom stakeholders to assess efforts to resolve the crippling energy crisis facing the country. Eskom announced earlier this week that loadshedding would remain at Stage 4 from 16:00 to 05:00 every day, with Stage 3 implemented from 05:00 to 16:00 during the day until further notice.
 
The committees felt that constant loadshedding was adverse impacting the country and exacerbating its socioeconomic challenges. The meeting will address the security of electricity supply, the operational state of all power stations and governance at Eskom. Solutions to the current loadshedding, as well as alleged sabotage and theft at power stations, will also be addressed at the meeting. “The aim of the interaction is to assess the interventions being rolled out to address the energy challenge and ensure security of energy supply. A secure energy supply will add impetus to efforts to grow the economy and address the unemployment challenge,” said Public Enterprises Portfolio Committee chairperson Khaya Magaxa. Select committee chairperson Zolani Mkiva said to achieve desired solutions, the committees were aware that there was a need for holistic engagement with all stakeholders to ensure a common vision. “It is for this fact that the committees will engage various stakeholders, including organised labour, the Eskom board and senior management, to ensure that there is a common goal that the entity is working towards. We have a responsibility as public representatives to do oversight and ensure challenges are resolved,” added Mkiva.
