Management consulting firm Kearney has appointed energy specialist Prashaen Reddy as an equity partner. A business leader with over 13 years of experience in consulting, including six years focused on strategy and transformation in key sectors such as energy, mining and chemicals, Reddy's participatory, collaborative approach to macroeconomic challenges has earned him widespread acclaim. Kearney partner and Africa MD Theo Sibiya says Reddy’s appointment as equity partner represents a timely recognition of his expertise in strategy and leadership that he will now bring to the table in helping Kearney continue its commitment to creating lasting value for people, economies and environments globally. This includes understanding and applying Kearney’s mantra of “What’s Next” by understanding that tomorrow’s thriving organisations will be the ones bold enough to change how they operate and become regenerative – functioning in a way that continually self-repairs. An energy sector veteran whose keen insights have driven growth across various key sectors and value chains in the South African economy, Reddy has championed a unique vision for South Africa's transformation, especially in the face of the ongoing energy crisis. “With an unparalleled working knowledge of South Africa's and Africa’s business landscape, Reddy is one of the renowned business leaders driving a just, inclusive energy transition in South Africa,” adds Sibiya. Well-poised to navigate the delicate nuances of South Africa’s energy transition, while strategically leveraging Kearney’s considerable coal and gas reserves, Reddy has collaborated with business leaders across key sectors to foment an inchoate shift from traditional oil and gas towards cleaner, renewable energy sources. Reddy says he sees South Africa as a “sleeping giant” of the global arena owing to the country’s strong economic potential in terms of natural resources, abundant solar and wind energy, electrical grid (which has strong transmission-side reliability, despite the catastrophic generation-side shortfalls) and human capacity. “Reddy brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the partnership and we look forward to supporting him in his vision for prosperity, inclusive growth and a just energy transition on the African continent,” says Sibiya.
